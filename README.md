This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Features

### Password Reset Functionality

The application includes a complete password reset system:

1. **Forgot Password**: Users can request a password reset by visiting `/forgot-password`
2. **Reset Token**: A secure token is generated and stored in the database with a 1-hour expiration
3. **Reset Password**: Users can set a new password using the reset link sent to their email
4. **Security**: Tokens are automatically cleared after use or expiration

**Note**: The application uses Resend to send password reset emails. Make sure to configure your `RESEND_API_KEY` in the environment variables.

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:

```env
# Database
DATABASE_URL="file:./dev.db"

# NextAuth
NEXTAUTH_URL="http://localhost:3000"
NEXTAUTH_SECRET="your-secret-key-here"

# Email (Resend)
RESEND_API_KEY="your-resend-api-key"
```
